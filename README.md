Cluster Optimisation by sampling of source

Optimal clustering by sampling the number of individuals 5 time adn lookign what is the more stable. By looking at the Adjuster Rand Index. The set of parameters the best best Adjusted Rand Index is then considered the best to use as the clustering is the most stable

1) Extract the data from the cultura.db database to create a new scientific-domain specific database
2) Nettoyer les occupations
3) Draw the networks
4) compare the networks with ARI

WJAC = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times a_i \times c_i
